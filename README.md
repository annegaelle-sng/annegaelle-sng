### Hi, I am Anne-Gaëlle 👋👩🏾‍💻

I'm a data analyst/scientist who is passionate about creating values from data and revealing stories behind numbers. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Python, R, SQL, and BI tools (Tableau/Power Bi). 

In my spare time I sometimes put on my front end developer and designer cape and I have fun building interfaces in ReactJs or in the classic HTML, Css, Javascript.
